Due to Moo Deng's viral online popularity, the number of daily visitors  to  the  zoo  doubled  in  early  September  2024. [12][13] Around  this  time,  some  visitors  have  harassed  the  baby  by

splashing  her  with  water [10][14] or  throwing  objects  at  her  to wake her up. As a result, the Khao Kheow Open Zoo installed security  cameras  around  her  enclosure.  The  zoo  director  has threatened legal action against visitors who harassed her. [15][16] [14] The misbehavior by some visitors has been widely condemned  online. [17][18] The  zoo  also  implemented  a  fiveminute time limit for visitors in order to accommodate the high volume. [19]

In September 2024, zoo director Narongwit Chodchoi announced that the zoo had begun the process of copyrighting and trademarking "Moo Deng the hippo" to raise funds for the zoo. [6][20] The zoo also plans to launch a continuous livestream to allow fans to watch Moo Deng live over the Internet. [21]

On  September  28,  Moo  Deng  was  the  subject  of  a Saturday  Night  Live sketch. [22] She  was parodied by Bowen Yang on Weekend Update, and  the  character  was  used  to  satirize  American pop-artist Chappell Roan's commentary on fame and political endorsements. [23]

## Welfare concerns

Animal welfare groups have expressed concern for Moo Deng. A spokesperson for People for the Ethical  Treatment  of  Animals  said,  "She  faces  a  lifetime  of  confinement,"  while  World  Animal Protection  said,  "Sharing  Moo  Deng  content  might  seem  innocuous,  but  it  promotes  cruelty  to animals." [24] The zoo's director, Narongwit Chodchoi, rejected the allegations and maintained that the facility ensures the welfare and quality of life for more than 2,000 animals. [24] The Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said that Moo Deng was well taken care of and that PETA was relying on "outdated" information. [24]
